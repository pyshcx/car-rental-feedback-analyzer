## üîß Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Error: "No module named 'textblob'"
```bash
pip install textblob
python -c "import textblob; textblob.TextBlob('test')"
```

### Error: "Resource punkt not found"
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('brown')"
```

### Error: "Streamlit command not found"
```bash
pip install streamlit
# or
python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Error: "File not found" for CSV
- Make sure `car_rental_reviews.csv` is in the same folder as your Python scripts
- Check that the filename is exactly correct (case-sensitive)

### Web app won't load
- Check if you're in the correct directory
- Try: `python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
- Make sure port 8501 is not blocked

## üéØ Demo Script for Presentation

### Opening (30 seconds):
"Good morning! Today I'll demonstrate an automated sentiment analysis system I built for car rental companies. This system can analyze hundreds of customer reviews in seconds and identify specific issues that need attention."

### Live Demo Part 1 - Single Review (60 seconds):
"Let me start by analyzing a single review. I'll type: 'The car was dirty and had engine problems. Staff was very rude and unhelpful.' 

As you can see, the system immediately identifies this as negative sentiment with a polarity score of -0.45. It also automatically detected three specific issues: cleanliness, vehicle condition, and service quality."

### Live Demo Part 2 - Bulk Analysis (90 seconds):
"Now let me show you the real power - bulk analysis. I'll upload this CSV file with 20 customer reviews... 

The system has analyzed all reviews in under 2 seconds. We can see that 40% are negative, 30% positive, and 30% neutral. The interactive charts show us exactly which issues are most common - vehicle condition appears in 4 reviews, service quality in 3 reviews."

### Business Value (30 seconds):
"For a car rental company, this means managers can instantly identify problems instead of manually reading hundreds of reviews. They can see that vehicle maintenance and staff training are the top priorities. This saves hours of work and enables faster response to customer concerns."

### Closing (30 seconds):
"The system includes both a command-line tool for automated reporting and this web interface for interactive analysis. All results can be exported for further action. Thank you - any questions?"

## üí° Pro Tips for Higher Grades

### Show Understanding:
- Explain why TextBlob was chosen (rule-based, good for general sentiment)
- Discuss limitations (doesn't understand sarcasm, context-dependent)
- Mention alternatives (VADER for social media, BERT for accuracy)

### Demonstrate Practical Thinking:
- "Real companies like Hertz could use this system"
- "This could process 1000s of reviews from TripAdvisor automatically"
- "Integration with customer service systems would enable real-time alerts"

### Technical Depth:
- Explain polarity scoring (-1 to +1 scale)
- Show how keyword matching identifies issues
- Discuss the importance of text preprocessing

### Future Improvements:
- Machine learning for custom issue categories
- Real-time data streaming from review platforms
- Multi-language support for international companies
- Integration with business intelligence dashboards
